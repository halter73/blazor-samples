# .NET 8 Blazor web app with OIDC

This sample features:

- A .NET 8 Blazor Web App with global auto interactivty.
  - This adds a `PersistingAuthenticationStateProvider` and `PersistentAuthenticationStateProvider` services to the
    server and client blazor apps respectively to capture authentication state and flow it between the server and client.
- OIDC authentication with Microsoft Entra without using any Entra-specific packages.
  - The goal is that this sample can be used as a starting point for any OIDC authentication flow.
- A minimal API backend using the JwtBearerHandler to validate JWT tokens saved by the Blazor app in the sign-in cookie.
- The BFF pattern using Aspire service discovery and YARP for proxying the requests to /weatherforecast on the backend with the `access_token` stored in the cookie.
- Automatic non-interactive token refresh with the help of a custom `CookieOidcRefresher`.

## Running the sample

1. Configure the OIDC provider. If using Microsoft Entra, you follow along with the comments in Program.cs. Here's an excerpt:

    ```csharp
    // Save the access and refresh tokens in the cookie, so we can authenticate requests to the "weatherapi" service.
    // The offline_access scope is required for the refresh token.
    oidcOptions.SaveTokens = true;
    oidcOptions.Scope.Add("offline_access");
    // The "Weather.Get" scope is configured in the Azure or Entra portal under "Expose an API".
    // This is necessary for MinimalApiJwt to be able to validate the access token with AddBearerJwt.
    oidcOptions.Scope.Add("https://{directory-name}.onmicrosoft.com/{client-id}/Weather.Get");
  
    // The "common" authority should be used for multi-tenant applications. You can also use the common
    // authority for single-tenant applications, but that requires a custom IssuerValidator as shown in the comments below.
    //oidcOptions.Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/";
    oidcOptions.Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0/";
    oidcOptions.ClientId = "{client-id}";
  
    // ClientSecret should not be compiled into the application assembly or checked into source control.
    // Instead consider user-secrets, Azure KeyVault and/or environment variables. Authentication scheme configuration
    // is automatically read from builder.Configuration["Authentication:Schemes:{SchemeName}:{PropertyName}"],
    // so ClientSecret will be read from "Authentication:Schemes:MicrosoftOidc:ClientSecret" configuration.
    //oidcOptions.ClientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
  
    // This configures the OIDC handeler to do authorization code flow only. Implicit grants and hybrid flows are unnecessary
    // in this mode. You do not need to check either box for the authorization endpoint to return access tokens or ID tokens.
    // The OIDC handler will automatically request the appropriate tokens using the code returned from the authorization endpoint.
    oidcOptions.ResponseType = "code";
    ```
2. Navigate to `Aspire/Aspire.AppHost` and `dotnet run`. This should start both the `BlazorWebOidc`` and `MinimalApiJwt` projects.
